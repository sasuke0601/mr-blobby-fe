          <br />
          Mr Blobby is a character originally featured on the British Saturday
          night Variety show Noel's House Party, broadcast on BBC One. Created
          by Charlie Adams, a writer for the show, Mr Blobby is a bulbous pink
          figure covered in yellow spots, with a permanent toothy grin and green
          jiggling eyes. Mr Blobby communicates only by saying the word "blobby"
          in an electronically altered voice, expressing his moods through tone
          of voice and repetition. He topped the UK Singles Chart with the 1993
          Christmas release "Mr Blobby".
